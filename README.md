# Deep learning-assisted end-to-end metalens imaging


<hr />

> **Abstract:** *Recent advances in metasurface lenses (metalenses) show great potential for opening a new era of compact imaging, photography, LiDAR, and VR/AR applications. However, the reported performances of manufactured broadband metalenses are still limited due to a fundamental trade-off between broadband focusing efficiency and operating bandwidth, resulting in chromatic aberrations, angular aberrations, and relatively low efficiency. Here, we demonstrate a deep learning-based image restoration framework to overcome these limitations and to realize end-to-end metalens imaging. The proposed image restoration framework achieves aberration-free full-color imaging for one of the largest mass-produced metalens (10-mm-diameter). The metalens imaging assisted by the neural network provides competitive image qualities compared to the ground truth.*
